# Data Tweening: Pivot Transformation

This web visualization demo showcases a [pivot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table) transformation being applied to a table of data through a process called data tweening. This example demonstrates how even complex data transformations such as pivot can be visually explained through a sequence of animated transitions. All animations are performed using CSS transitions and a little JavaScript trickery.
